\title{In the unweighted case, suppose that (u) and (v) are sets of vectors, and that 
   A = a_1 * u_1 u_1^T + ... + a_j * u_j u_j^T = U diag(a) U^T
   B = b_1 * v_1 v_1^T + ... + b_j * v_k v_k^T = V diag(b) V^T,
where U is the matrix whose columns are (u), and likewise for V.
Then 
   (A-B)^T (A-B) = A^T A + B^T B - A^T B - B^T A
and so
   ||A-B||^2 = ||A||^2 + ||B||^2 - 2 tr( A^T B )
By the cyclic invariance of trace, if X = U^T V then
   tr( A^T B ) = tr( U diag(a) U^T V diag(b) V^T ) = tr( diag(a) X diag(b) X^T ) .}
\usage{
dist_from_pcs(values1, vectors1, values2, vectors2)
}
\description{
In the weighted case, we should use W^{1/2} A W^{1/2} instead of A (and likewise for B);
which means premultiplying U and V by sqrt(w); assume this has been done already.
}
\details{
The code does not check that vectors1 and vectors2 are each orthonormal.
