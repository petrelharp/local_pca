\usage{
read_vcf(file, phased = FALSE, triallelic = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Input .vcf file, possibly gzip'ped.}

\item{phased}{Are the data phased? (i.e., should return one column per individual or two?)}

\item{triallelic}{Include triallelic sites? Defaults to TRUE.}
}

\description{
Reads specified chromsomes from a .vcf file and recodes the data into numeric format:
   0 = major homozygote
   1 = heterozygote
   2 = minor homozygote
where "major" is the most common allele at that site, and all others are lumped as "minor".
Assumes that anything not in "ACGT" is NA (case-sensitive).
